Udemy Course [Android N: From Beginner to Paid Professional] (https://www.udemy.com/learn-android/learn/v4/overview)

What I learned from this part of the course:
- Introduction on how to create multiple fragments while having control of them in Main Activity.
- Learned to create a customized toolbar on Activity Main to then apply it into all the fragments.

What I learned and implemented myself:
- Implemented OOP in order to transfer data from one fragment to another with getters.
- Used data obtained from each fragment to show results on the last fragment.

Purpose:
- To understand how fragments work which then lead me to ask myself whether if I should use fragments or activities when creating projects.
